Scientific Research
===================

In my previous life I was a scientist.  

I obtained a Ph. D. in computational materials physics in San Sebastian, Spain.  After that I did a few postdocs, in Aalto University Laboratory of Physics and in the Helsinki University laboratory of Physical Chemistry.  I also supervised a doctoral thesis.

My scientific research has touched upon several topics:

- Complex silicon surface reconstructions
- Plasmons
- Electronic properties of graphene
- Computational catalysis
- Water and ice chemistry
- Proton disorder in ice

You can find all my papers in `Google Scholar <http://scholar.google.fi/citations?user=AlI_yOgAAAAJ>`_

My thesis is available `here <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/152t7nxq8v0cstt/AACAHOWngc220l3ZkuWXLSDfa?dl=0>`_

My Ph.D. student did a nice work in creating a software called `Ice Package <https://github.com/pauliparkkinen/ice_package>`_ (keywords: ice, proton disorder, configurational entropy)
