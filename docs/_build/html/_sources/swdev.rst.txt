Software Development
====================

My Software Stack
-----------------

I can do stuff with all the most popular programming languages.

At the moment, my core competence lies first in Python and then in C++ and especially, in interfacing between those two with the aid of swig.

I love Qt and especially the "PyQt" strategic combination.


Dasys Ltd
---------

During the past years, I've been working at Dasys Ltd as a lead software architect, software developer, system's administrator, etc. (sometimes even as the janitor).

We have written and deployed a highly customized video streaming and recording software suite for `Nordic Simulators Oy <http://www.nordicsimulators.com/recorders.html>`_.

Currently we are developing an OpenSource video management library for Linux.

So, what's an "video management system" (aka VMS) you say?

A VMS is a server/client that is able to:

- Stream video from IP cameras
- Show the live video on-screen
- Save the stream
- Search the stream and show recorded video on-screen
- Recast the stream to other server/client

In order to create video surveillance and analysis software, you need a decent VMS.  There are several companies offering their (closed source) solutions, such as Milestone, Mirasys and Avigilon.

What most closed-source and proprietary VMSes still lack these days are:

- Possibility for scripting (in Python), say: "if John detected in video, send e-mail to John's mom"
- Modularity : plug-in your (Python) machine vision routines
- Ability to share decoded frames across processes
- Ability to do fisheye projections
- Be able to create easily customizable graphical user interfaces (GUI)
- Must be OpenSource and work in Linux desktop
- Work with off-the-shelf OnVif compliant IP cameras
- etc., etc.

Our programming library (will) offer all that, and much more.  Feel free to check out the project `here <https://elsampsa.github.io/valkka-examples/_build/html/index.html>`_.
